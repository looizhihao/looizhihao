ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhi Hao
Currently working as a Data Scientist in UTAR 
<br />
I usually kept all my project private, but recently I decided to share some of them.<br />
But I'm still extracting and cleaning up some of them to remove P&C information. <br />
Do check me out from time to time.<br />


Projects to be uncovered soon:<br />
-named pipe for c++ to talk to python script <br />
-python database library <br />

*Disclaimer: Not all codes in those project are written by my own, but a collection of codes compile togther from various sources.<br />
Will try to include everysource but I might miss out since some project are done long time ago.<br />
Please let me know if I used your code without tagging you.<br />
My contact: looizhihao@hotmail.com<br />
