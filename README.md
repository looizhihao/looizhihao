ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zhi Hao
Currently working as a Data Scientist in UTAR 

I usually kept all my project private, but I recently decided to share some of them.
But I'm still extracting and cleaning up some of them to remove P&C information. 
Do check me out from time to time.

my contact: looizhihao@hotmail.com
project to be uncovered soon:
-named pipe for c++ to talk to python script 
-python database connector and connection tester

*Disclaimer: Not all codes in those project are written by my own, but a collection of codes compile togther from various sources.
Will try to include everysource but I might miss out since some project are done long time ago.
Please let me know if I used your code without tagging you.
